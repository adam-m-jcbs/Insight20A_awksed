# Contributing

Contributions are welcomed from anyone, including posting issues or
submitting pull requests to the [`Insight20A_awksed` github](https://github.com/adam-m-jcbs/Insight20A_awksed).

## Issues

Creating an issue on github is a good way to request new features,
file a bug report, or notify the community of any difficulties that arise using
this repository.

To request support, please create an issue.

If you are reporting a bug, please indicate any information necessary to
reproduce the bug, including versions of relevant software.

## Pull Requests

*Submitting a pull request means you would like to be a co-author
of this repository and release all your contributions to the
project under the terms of the BSD-3 license, retaining copyright
to all of your own code.* 

A pull request should be generated by forking this code base to your own GitHub
account, making any desired changes, and then targeting a pull request at the
`master` branch.  In the future, we may use a `development` branch and insist
on a policy of all PRs being submitted as temporary feature branches.  But
for now, we will keep it simple with `master`.
