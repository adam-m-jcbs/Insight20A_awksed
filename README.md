# Insight 20A `awk` and `sed` workshop

This repository is the core of a simple, hands-on tutorial meant to demonstrate awk and sed fundamentals.  It was developed for the NY DevOps Engineering Fellows of Insight's 20A session.

The initial, original author is Adam Jacobs, who hopes to have many others contribute PRs to this repository, expanding the list of creators.

## How to do this tutorial

As of now, I've kept things basic.  So, go to `/awk/`, open `awk_playground.sh`, and see what the comments say.

After this, do the same in `/sed/`.

Finally, see why it's so common for these two to be paired by getting some practice composing them in `/awksed/`.
